This directory used to contain official implementations for Bayesian optimisation works developed by Huawei R&D, Noah's Ark Lab. Which has now moved to - [BO: Bayesian Optimisation](https://github.com/huawei-noah/HEBO) with specific repositories moved to 
- [HEBO: Heteroscedastic Evolutionary Bayesian Optimisation](https://github.com/huawei-noah/HEBO/tree/master/HEBO) 
- [T-LBO](https://github.com/huawei-noah/HEBO/tree/master/T-LBO)
- [Bayesian Optimisation with Compositional Optimisers](https://github.com/huawei-noah/HEBO/tree/master/CompBO)

Further instructions are provided in the README
