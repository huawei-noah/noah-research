### MSP (Maximum Softmax Probabiltiy) and Mahalanobis score for CNN, LSTM and CBOW models.

```bash
python scripts/_run_transformer.py hydra.run.dir=.
```
This scirpt runs MSP method training and  a subsequent evaluation with default configuration
*../configs/config_msp_cnn.yaml*. By specifying *classifier=MODEL_NAME*, one can choose the model.
For available models, look in the folder *configs/classifier*.



### Likelihood ratio
```bash
python scripts/_likelihood_ratio.py hydra.run.dir=.
```
This script runs the LLR method training and a subsequent evaluation with default 
configuration given in the *../configs/config_likelihood_clinc.yaml*. This configuration
uses CLINC dataset, the other two configurations are suitable for ROSTD and SNIPS datasets.
This configuration files contains the best hyperparameters for each of the datasets found
by hyperparameter search. To run other config rewrite *config_path* in *_run_likelihood_ratio.py*. 


## Hyperparmeters
We use LSTMs as the main and the background model for the LLR approach. 
The LSTMs hyperparameters are listed in the configuration files provided with the code. 
In our experiments using Transformer-based models did not show any improvements.

For experiments with MSP, we use the similar architecture of CNN provided in 
[Zheng er al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03862). 
We found that this architecture with the Mahalanobis distance score 
performs poorly, mainly because of the dropout layers. Our experiments show that the 
substitution of dropout layers with batch normalization layers leads to substantial 
improvement in OOD metrics (the accuracy on the ID examples are comparable) for CNN 
with the Mahalanobis OOD score.

For SST-2 setup, we used CNN with filters of sizes [2, 3, 4, 5] 
with 128 channels. Then we use pooling over time and concatenate features obtained from 
the filters of different sizes. This gives the sentence embeddings of size 512. On top of 
these features, a dropout and a linear layer are used, mapping embedding to class logits. 
This architecture follows the one used in [Hendrycks er al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06100).

Transformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, etc) OOD detectors consist of the Transformer model 
itself and a dropout and a linear layer on top of the embedding for [CLS] token.

### Hyperparameter search
We performed hyperparameter search using the following grid for Transformer models
  - Learning rate: [1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5]
  - Batch size: [16, 32]

We selected the best model by $AUPR_{OOD}$ metric. 
For each hyperparameter configuration, we averaged the results over 10 runs.

We searched for the best LLR model over the following grid
   - Learning rate: [1-3, 5e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5, 1e-5]
   - Main model LSTM hidde size: [256, 300, 512]
   - Background model LSTM hidden size: [64, 128, 256, 512]
   - Background model $L_{2}$-regularization coefficient: 
     [1e-4$, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 0, 1, 10, 100]
   - Input dropout: [0, 0.3, 0.5]
   - Output dropout: [0, 0.3, 0.5]
   - Batch size: [16, 32, 64, 128]

The procedure for selecting the model is the same as for transformers.

## Computing infrastructure
Each experiment was done using a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 GPU, requiring no longer than 2 hours.
